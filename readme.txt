== Description ==

# Description

featured-image shortcode allows a floating featured image to be placed at the top of a post. Default settings can be entered to simplify the use of the plugin.

When used several parameters are available for use:
 1. image - to use an image other than the default.
 2. title - set a title on the image (will appear in the tooltip).
 3. alt - enter the alt text for when the image cannot be displayed.
 4. taxonomy - enter a category or tag name or slug to have a hyperlink added to the image.
 5. is_tag - set to 1 for when the taxonomy should be a tag instead of a category.

List of images can be saved for easy use in future.

This plugin is multisite compatible; each site will need settings to be configured in the admin dashboard.
